# My tinder bot
## Idea: not waste time on tinder
Create a tinder bot to run 24/7 on my old computer while I run a EC2 instance on my current computer so it notifies me about news on new messages, matches etc. 

It has a fun conversation with the girl through message codes until the girl enters that she wants to talk to me personally.


Nice fun project to release stress on midterm week.
